                    power. It opens up exciting opportunities for change-makers,
                    creators aspiring to light a fire of passion with flickering
                    ideas that brightens our future. TED Women brings together

                    to make sure women's voices are heeded, not overlooked and
                    ignored.

                        <!-- Climate change has environmental, social, political, and
                        economic repercussions. Our TEDx SPEAKERS ask the hard
                        questions: how human beings influence the Earth’s
                        temperatures? How will these changes affect communities
                        and species across the globe? And, importantly, is there
                        still time to change our ways?
                        <br />
                        Our speakers are industrialists ,influencers and UG
                        students ,who aim to make this planet a better place of
                        living , not a planet where we have to fight for
                        survival. They have already taken the first step forward
                        via many NGOs and voicing out the seething issue at
                        hand, in turn spreading awareness.
                        <br />
                        Here’s a list of our speakers: -->
                        The best way to celebrate women is letting them speak
                        for themselves. The grandeur of
                        TEDxChennaiInstituteofTechnologyWomen will be adorned by
                        the presence of awe - inspiring women speakers from
                        various walks who have carved their way into success,
                        inspired many and worked their way to change the society
                        for the better by their remarkable contributions. In
                        line with our notion that “ Empowered Women Empower the
                        World”, the stage is set for the world to hear the
                        stories of these outstanding women and be empowered.
